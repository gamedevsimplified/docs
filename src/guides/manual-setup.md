!!!
This setup uses the `Basic` template as an example. If you're using a cloned template, apply the same steps to your version instead.
!!!

You can manually integrate a demo template into your scene by following these steps:

### 1. Add a _UI Document_

To add a **UI Document**, right-click the hierarchy and select `UI Toolkit > UI Document`.

<!-- !!!
A UI Document is required to render UI Toolkit layouts (UXML and USS) in the scene.
!!! -->

### 2. Assign UI Assets

Select the **UI Document** object in the scene. Navigate to the desired demo folder (`GDS/Demos/Basic` in this example), and drag the **Panel Settings** and **Visual Tree Asset** into their corresponding fields in the **UI Document** component.

These assets handle styling and layout.

### 3. Add Inventory Scripts

Go to `Demos/Basic/Scene/Scripts` and add the `InventoryEvents` and `InventoryInput` scripts to the **UI Document** object.

`InventoryEvents` handles item spawning when dropped and cleanup when picked up.

`InventoryInput` listens for keyboard input and forwards it to the inventory.

### 4. Assign the Player Transform

If you don't already have a `Player` object in the scene tree, create a cube and name it `Player`.

Select the **UI Document**, expand the `InventoryEvents` component and drag the `Player` object from the scene into the **Player Transform** field.

### 5. Assign Item and VFX Prefabs

Go to `Common/Prefabs` and drag `WorldItem` prefab into the **Item Prefab** field and `PickupVFX` prefab into the **PickupVFX** field.

**Items** dropped on the ground will spawn at random positions around the **Player**.

You can adjust the **Drop Radius** and **Drop Offset** here.
