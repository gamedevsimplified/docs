## Introduction

The purpose of this package is to provide a versatile and extensible solution for creating inventories in Unity. Its design allows developers to quickly set up functional inventories while offering the flexibility to adapt to custom use cases. The framework supports a variety of inventory types, making it suitable for a wide range of games. 

The predefined inventory types are:
   - **List**: A collection of items arranged as a list or a grid.
   - **Set**: Equipment type inventory with named slots.
   - **Grid** (PRO): Supports items of varying sizes.

Built on [UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html), it offers advanced styling and layout capabilities while avoiding the overhead of `GameObjects` and `Prefabs`. 
It also comes bundled with an abstract yet powerful **item system** that minimizes setup while supporting diverse use cases.
