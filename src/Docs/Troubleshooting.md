### UI Toolkit Debugger

Since UI Toolkit uses a form of CSS, it also inherits all the downsides of the cascading aspect - always check for unintended style propagation affecting your UI.

 Use the UI Toolkit Debugger (`Window > UI Toolkit > Debugger`) to inspect the visual elements tree and its styles and classes.

### Built-in Debugger

Use the included *Debug* editor windows  to view the raw state of the system. These tools help identify whether issues originate from the data layer or the view layer.
