Its design allows developers to quickly set up functional inventories while offering the flexibility to adapt to custom use cases. The framework supports a variety of inventory types, making it suitable for a wide range of games.","The predefined inventory types are:","List: A collection of items arranged as a list or a grid.","Set: Equipment type inventory with named slots.","Grid(PRO): Supports items of varying sizes.","Built on UI Toolkit, it offers advanced styling and layout capabilities while avoiding the overhead of GameObjects and Prefabs. It also comes bundled with an abstract yet powerful item system that minimizes setup while supporting diverse use cases."]}],[{"l":"Architecture Overview \uD83D\uDEA7","p":["The framework follows a data-driven, event-based architecture. It keeps data, logic, and UI separate.","Inventories can get complex very quickly — stacking, moving, crafting, containers, world drops, sounds, etc.","To keep things manageable and extensible, the system is divided into clear responsibilities.","Bags→ hold data","Stores→ define rules","Views→ render UI","Manipulators→ add UI Interaction Behaviors","Controllers→ wire everything together","Event bus→ connects these pieces without tightly coupling them."]},{"l":"Bag","p":["Bags are pure data containers. Think of a Bag as the state of an inventory — nothing more.","A Bag stores items, does not contain UI logic but can define some gameplay rules. For example a bag can be configured to be remove only or accept only a certain type of items.","Because Bags are UI-agnostic, they can be reused across different interfaces or even outside UI contexts (e.g., crafting systems, world storage, containers inside items).","Examples: Equipment, Shop, Crafting Bench"]},{"l":"Item","p":["Items are based on ScriptableObject definitions (ItemBase) with runtime instances (Item).","Items describe what something is, not how it behaves in the UI.","This allows:","Easy editor configuration","Reusable item definitions","Custom item types (e.g., container items)"]},{"l":"Store","p":["Stores contain the logic of the system.","A Store:","Listens to events (e.g., Pick, Place, Drop)","Applies validation rules","Updates Bags","Publishes result events","For example, a Store decides whether an item can be moved, whether stacks can merge, what happens when an item is dropped into the world.","Stores define what is allowed, but they do not render anything. This makes behavior easy to customize — you can swap or extend Stores without changing Views."]},{"l":"Manipulator","p":["Manipulators are small, reusable interaction components attached to the root visual element. They are responsible for translating user input into high-level intent.","For example, Manipulators enable behaviors such as:","Drag and drop","Tooltips","Item rotation","Right-click / double-click actions","Slot highlighting","A Manipulator typically:","Listens to pointer or keyboard events.","Applies activation rules (e.g., modifier keys, mouse buttons).","Publishes an event to the event bus.","Importantly, Manipulators do not modify Bags directly. They only interpret input and emit intent."]},{"l":"Controller","p":["Controllers do not define gameplay rules. They simply connect the parts of the system together.","They:","Create or reference Bags","Inject Bags into Stores","Bind Bags to Views","Attach behavior in form of Manipulators"]},{"l":"Event Bus","p":["The event bus allows systems to communicate without direct references.","For example:","A Manipulator publishes a \"Pick\" event.","The Store reacts and updates a Bag.","The View re-renders automatically.","A sound system listens and plays an effect.","Because everything communicates through events:","Features can be added without modifying core systems.","Sound, VFX, and world spawning remain optional.","The framework stays modular and extensible."]}],[{"l":"Core API \uD83D\uDEA7"},{"l":"Bag (Base Class)","p":["Bag is the abstract base class for all inventory containers.","It defines the common contract for storing, validating, and manipulating Item instances.","Concrete implementations (e.g., ListBag, GridBag, CraftingBench) provide the actual behavior.","The base implementation intentionally does very little — most methods return Result.Fail by default.","Derived classes are expected to override the relevant methods."]}],[{"l":"Troubleshooting \uD83D\uDEA7"},{"l":"Discord Server","p":["Join the Discord server for additional support from the developer and the community."]},{"l":"Document doesn't look right in UI Builder","p":["If you open a document in UI Builder and it looks like it doesn't have the right styling, make sure to select the right theme from the dropdown.","Each demo comes with its own theme, grid examples use GDS Grid, and the rest - GDS Default.","In rare cases, themes may become corrupted during import. This is usually caused by an invalid asset path or GUID mismatch. If this occurs, please contact the developer for assistance."]},{"l":"Objects in the scene do not react to pointer","p":["Add Physics Raycaster component to main camera.","Add EventSystem component to scene hierarchy.","Make sure the UI Document is not blocking input.
